# Thermal_stress_prediction_using-PROPHET-FORECAST-TIME-SERIES
This project is about the prediction of the thermal stress of a pressure vessel made of stainless steel using Prophet Forecast Time Series.


Pressure vessels (PV) are important equipment with versatile application in different manufacturing and process engineering industries. They can be used as reactors and storage device in nuclear engineering, a mixing chamber for chemical industries, oil refinery and so on. The equipment is expected to work under normal operating range without comprising its safety and reliability. This variation translates to transient in behaviour of PV and inability to capture it properly can lead to compromise of the structure that can result to physical injuries to people around the facility as well as property damage. 

Therefore, PV should be subjected to both normal design operational condition as well as conditions beyond their design limit by considering transient cases which makes estimation of stress, fatigue and structural integrity with respect to thermal (heat) load included in its design challenging. The transient condition due to sudden or gradual change in the thermal condition of PV is important in engineering application. The design of such vessels needs to be broadened with a detailed thermal stress due to its time-dependent different behaviours experienced under load.

In prediction of transient thermal and heat flux analysis and stress analysis of pressure vessel designs with respect to the variation in time, a machine learning algorithm was developed; a model based on Prophet Forecast Model PFM (a time series analysis tool) which also predicts new time variation with targeted variables.
